### Partnership Analysis
This is a quick overview of each partner's individual traits
and a detailed exploration of how they manifest in your interactions.
Focus areas include:

#### Conflict Mechanics
⁃ Sources of disagreements and ways to address them
⁃ How to avoid turning your strengths into weapons during arguments

#### Growth and Development
⁃ Collaborative decision-making

⁃ Supporting your partner effectively

⁃ Recognizing and validating less obvious needs

#### Sexuality Mechanics
⁃ What makes me attractive in my partner’s eyes
⁃ Correct strategies for entering relationships

#### The World Through Your Partner’s Eyes
⁃ Understanding how your partner perceives news, relationships, and themselves

### Expected Outcome
This analysis offers a fresh perspective on your relationship, helping to improve mutual understanding and build a stronger, more harmonious connection.
It’s about identifying root causes rather than fighting symptoms.
It’s about being together while staying true to yourself.

#### Is my partner's presence required?
No, consultations can be conducted individually or with both partners.

#### How do I work?
⁃ Up to 2 sessions, in Berlin or online
⁃ 1 session per week
⁃ Languages: Ukrainian, Russian, English

#### Cost
**€100** per session, lasting **60 minutes**

I work selectively, only after a preliminary 15-minute online conversation.
