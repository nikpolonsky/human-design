### Human Design in Simple Terms
#### What kind of design?
⁃ Human Design. An empirical system of self-discovery.

#### Why do I need it?
⁃ It's a chance to reprogram yourself. To build an authentic connection with yourself and live your own life.

#### What does that mean?
⁃ Reprogramming means revisiting your understanding of yourself. Identifying what is truly "you" and what is external influence.
How and why the external takes over and steers you off course.

#### Sounds a bit vague
⁃ And too good to be true, I get it.
It’s not easy to sum up, but if what’s said here resonates, reach out.

I’ll hand you a map and compass.
To be precise, you are both the map and compass—I just offer an instruction manual.
Whether to use it or not is up to you, as is judging its validity.

#### How do I work?
⁃ Up to 3 sessions in Berlin or online

⁃ 1 session per week

⁃ Languages: Ukrainian, Russian, English

#### Cost
**€60** per session, lasting **45 minutes**

I work selectively, only after a preliminary 15-minute online conversation.

You can contact me via Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram:

### About Me
I am a mathematician and programmer with a fascination for mysticism. I started studying Human Design in 2019, drawn by its depth and unique perspective.
Through extensive experimentation, I came to realize that the system works.

Human Design offered me an answer to the question: Who am I?

An answer that, when you hear it, you instantly recognize as true.

It’s influenced my worldview, career, relationships, and parenting.

## Other Projects
### [Blog](/archives/)
I write about my life through the lens of Human Design.

If you're considering a consultation, I recommend reading a few of these posts.
I’m as candid and open as possible there—a good chance to calibrate your expectations.

For example, [here](/2020/04/24/my-experience-in-experimentation), I talk about how experimenting with Human Design impacted my life and relationships.

And [here](/2020/04/25/fork-on-the-road), I explain why I chose not to attend an official school.

### [Human Design Mechanics](/mechanics/)
A mobile app for iOS.
The product of my love for programming and Human Design, created with a focus on simplicity and usability.
An excellent companion for your experiment.
